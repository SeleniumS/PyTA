# Installing Python on Windows

Installing Python on Windows is not something, I confess, that I know a lot about, and so I am working from multiple documents and multiple possibilities, with the hope that I can try some of these things out in advance of the workshop. (The only active Windows machine we have in our household is my daughter's Surface -- perhaps it's time I fired up that machine the cabinet after all.)

The best solution appears to be an all-in-one package called [Anaconda][], which has all the libraries we will be using in the workshop: both Python and iPython as well as `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `nltk`. Let's start there!
