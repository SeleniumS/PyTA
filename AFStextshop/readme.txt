# ReadMe

## Welcome

Thank for signing up for the (first ever?) workshop on text analytics, also sometimes known as text mining, offered by the American Folklore Society. This USB drive contains, in addition to this "read me" file (in both markdown as well as HTML), the following:

* In the `software` directory (folder), there is:
	 - a complete, working copy of the Voyant software. (More information about Voyant is available on [Voyant's GitHub page][] and its [website][].) *This is the software with which we will be principally working.*
	 - Complete installation packages for both the macOS and Windows of the Anaconda distribution of Python. *We may or may not get to this, but I wanted to make your future explorations easier by including it.*
* In the `docs` directory, there are multiple copies (PDF, epub, and mobi) of _Introduction to Text Analysis_ by Brandon Walsh and Sarah Horowitz. It is also available [online as a GitBook][].
* Finally in the `data` directory, which could just as easily have been labelled `texts`, there is the following:
	- a directory of texts of the Grimms folktales as digitized and made available by published by [D. L. Ashliman][]. 
	- a small collection of legends texts taken from [my own research][].
	- and the text of Richard Connell's "The Most Dangerous Game," which was published in 1926 and thus is now in the public domain.

If you have enjoyed this workshop, please feel free to write my dean to let him know this. (If you are especially taken with the handy USB drive with 32GB of storage that was your takeaway for attending the workshop, feel free to let him know that it was money well spent.)

## Agenda

*Text analytics* means in general the application of some form of computation to the analysis of texts. It can be one text, one hundred texts, one thousand texts, one million text, one ... you get the idea. To demonstrate the utility of these reading methods and to maximize our time together, our workshop is designed to allow us to explore analyzing the following:

* one text: "The Most Dangerous Game"
* a small collection (dozens) of texts: some legends from Louisiana
* a larger collection (hundreds) of texts: the Grimms (in translation)

Our goal will be to explore texts and textuality in terms of:

* word/term frequencies
* word/term distributions
* words in context
* ngrams and collocations
* co-occurrences

With those as some of the possibilities, it should also be noted that this is your workshop and that we will proceed in ways that you find most interesting. (This stuff is all interesting to me, but we don't have that kind of time.)

## Thanks

Two thanks are owed for this workshop: the first to the AFS directorate for encouraging it and the second to the University of Louisiana for outfitting each of you with these spiffy USB drives. 

I trust you know how to get in touch with our directors, Tim Lloyd and Lorraine Walsh-Cashman, but if you would like to drop a note to the folks at UL-Lafayette, please direct your comments to my dean:

Dean Jordan Kellman
College of Liberal Arts
University of Louisiana
Lafayette, LA 70504-3551

Or feel free to email him if you prefer: kellman@louisiana.edu. Let him know that the workshop was helpful and that the USB drives were cool.
